An interactive visualization of binary patterns in powers of numbers, inspired by Stephen Wolfram's "A New Kind of Science". This project reveals the interesting transition from regular to chaotic behavior in the binary representations of powers.

Features:
- Real-time visualization of binary patterns
- Dynamic animation with adjustable base numbers
- Interactive pan and zoom controls
- Automatic scaling for large numbers
- Touch and mouse support

Tech Stack:
- React
- Tailwind CSS
- shadcn/ui components
- Web APIs for smooth animations
